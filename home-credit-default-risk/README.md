# Home Credit Default Risk

## Kaggle Competition

This was my code for the Kaggle competition Home Credit Default Risk by Home Credit Group. The objective was to predict how capable each applicant was of repaying a loan. I used seaborns and pandas to explore the data and lightgbm and xgboost to create the final predictions.

## Data Source

The data used can be downloaded from the Kaggle competition page located [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data).
